## RSA algorithm

`RSA algorithm` is asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.

### Implementation
* A public key is given
* A message is given
* Two prime numbers are considered or given
* Euler's totient function is computed
* Encryption happens using the public key and the message
* Private key is derived
* The cipher text is decrypted
